            Earth's population has surpassed 10 billion people, placing major strain on resources and
            in particular energy. Some powerful individuals are ecstatic at the population boom and believe it will be good for the
            economy while others are completely fearful on what potential havoc this number brings. Among the debates is a whisper - "we
            must consider exploring other habitable planets now, before it is too late.

            Earth's resources are being extracted at a high rate in order to provide for the growing population.
            This causes an increase in pollution and greenhouse gases as climate change begins to wreak havoc causing
            more natural disasters across the globe. Amidst this chaos are small voices of scientists advocating for space travel.

            Should we simply abandon Earth due to our own failures? Being born on Earth, humans should have a responsibility to manage
            and mitigate their environmental damage in the same way individuals may keep their house clean and safe. In a sense, to abandon
            Earth would be abandoning our faith that humanity can come together and bring forward a solution to climate change. That said,
            it would be naive to not consider the prospect of space travel and the outcomes it may bring.

            amount of funding, a project that focuses on becoming an interplanetary species.

            one tenth the speed of light. Unfortunately, Earth's condition has only worsened leading to a divided opinion on whether or not to use this technology
            for space travel. Some voices believe that no funding should of every gone to space travel and instead the current humans should have been put first
            before the future generations. Others believe that it is because there was not enough funding that caused a long time for a breakthrough to come and thus
            we should only invest more into space travel.
