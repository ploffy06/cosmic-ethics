        events: `
            Earth's population has surpassed 10 billion people, placing major strain on resources and
            in particular energy. Some powerful individuals are ecstatic at the population boom and believe it will be good for the
            economy while others are completely fearful on what potential havoc this number brings. Among the debates is a whisper - "we
            must consider exploring other habitable planets now, before it is too late.

        moral_duties: `
            What actions must we take to ensure the survival of the population while ensuring the balance between
            the preservation of the current generation and survival of future generations. The primary focus surrounds resource allocation as well
            as the conservation of resources. Perhaps new laws and regulations  on the distrubution and usage of resources will have to be put into
            place. However, this may disrupt business markets which in turn causes social outcry.

        events: `
            Earth's resources are being extracted at a high rate in order to provide for the growing population.
            This causes an increase in pollution and greenhouse gases as climate change begins to wreak havoc causing
            more natural disasters across the globe. Amidst this chaos are small voices of scientists advocating for space travel.

        moral_duties: `
            Should we simply abandon Earth due to our own failures? Being born on Earth, humans should have a responsibility to manage
            and mitigate their environmental damage in the same way individuals may keep their house clean and safe. In a sense, to abandon
            Earth would be abandoning our faith that humanity can come together and bring forward a solution to climate change. That said,
            it would be naive to not consider the prospect of space travel and the outcomes it may bring.

            The population and climate crisis grows more severe and begins to pressure governments to form an alliance.
            Governments worldwide are gathered for a historic conference where they discuss the future of humanity.
            The conference was held to discuss space travel to "save" humanity is raised and finally the governments decide to fund, though only a small
            amount of funding, a project that focuses on becoming an interplanetary species.

            Should space deserve more funding, and if so how would we justify the immense cost of venturing into the unknown while many suffer on Earth?
            Times of existential crisis towards the entire human race can both bring forward international breakdown but also  global cooperation. In the case
            of space travel, it seems to have an ability to bring forward unity. Perhaps in a time of crisis, unity and hope is needed.

        events: `
            After many decades of of research and engineering, a breakthrough is made in propulsion technology that can allow a spacecraft to travel at
            one tenth the speed of light. Unfortunately, Earth's condition has only worsened leading to a divided opinion on whether or not to use this technology
            for space travel. Some voices believe that no funding should of ever gone to space travel and instead the current humans should have been put first
            before the future generations. Others believe that it is because there was not enough funding that caused a long time for a breakthrough to come and thus
            we should only invest more into space travel.

            With a new technology and power to travel at a high speed that will allow the first step towards becoming an interplanetary species and potentially save humanity,
            is it our obligation to use this technology? However, the technology also requires  resources which may have  dire environmental impact on the already
            damaged bioecosystems. The conversation surrounds the value  of the  current living generation vs the quality of life for the  future generations.

            more 'highly likely' to succeed on their mission. Yet, how is that fair as  not everyone has had the oppurtunity to have access to education. Moreover, how is it
            fair to individuals who were directly impacted by the damage that the construction  of the ship incurred if they are not able to board the ship.
            There must be deep consideration on having a  diverse range of opposing voices and  skillsets for the  group of individuals embarking on the expedition.

            the survival of the human race does hold great importance.

            also preserve the identity of Earth? Yes. It is instrumental to preserve the history but history can be taught subjectively.
            Should the individuals on this planet learn to strive for space travel  or learn to strive to  preserve the current generations
