            I was born aboard Odyssey into a world surrounded by nothing but a black abyss. Mother and father often spoke stories to
            me that their mothers and fathers and their mothers and fathers told them. A far-away planet called Earth where humanity began.
            A planet with billions of humans, animals and plants filled with opportunity and meaningful relationships that meant something more
            than the need to procreate and survive as a species. A planet where humans were individual beings. Mother and father said Earth was not like
            Odyssey at all. Humans on Earth fought over land, resources and didn't seem to share the same way we do. On Odyssey, we lived in harmony
            and we helped each other in the name of the greater cause of the human race. Every human on the ship had a role to play, the engineer, the doctor,
            the mathematician and so on. Many problems had simple binary answers; if you injured yourself then you see a doctor, if the doctor was busy
            then you wait your turn. There was no need to cry or argue. If we allowed ourselves to be like the humans on Earth who did not live in harmony,
            Odyssey would of been a sinking ship.

            I don't condemn Earth's humans in any way and I have cherished and enjoyed every part of my life.
            What was there to hate when I have known no other life other than my own?

            Yet, as we soon land on Aurora, I can't help but feel that the roles we have been playing on this ship will change.
            I wonder what it must be like to be born into a world that had more than a black window to gaze out of.

            I have been with farmer Fredrick as an apprentice for over a year now. He has taught me the ways  of growing and harvesting crops
            along with how we must ration them so that every  individual on Aurora will thrive. It is hard but honest work.

            Every night, I  look out my window  and gaze into the night sky scattered with many stars. My generation was born  to terraform the planet
            and create a new human civilization. We were made sure to have happy childhoods and a good education to eventually take a  questionaire that determinted
            where we belonged. For me, it was on a farm and I have always felt belonging with farmer Fredrick who has treated me with nothing but kindness and fatherly
            love. I wonder if stars had any purpose like we did in the vastness of the black abyss? Stars seem to  simply exists and serve  no role or purpose nor does it
            do anything to help other stars. What sort of place does a star have in the universe?

            I did not ask to be born on Aurora and take a mere quiz to determine the fate of the rest of my life. I want freedom and individuality. I want to be an explorer of the
            world and live the human experience. What is humanity's place in the universe? My parents thinks I am corrupting minds of my peers yet I have managed to amass a great deal of followers.
            That has to mean something, that has to mean what I feel is something human. I am forever grateful to the past generations to having built a civilization. I am honoured to be
            born on Aurora. But the generations before us came here with purpose to build civilization. Well civilization has been built. We have cities across the globe and a striving population.
            So why are we still living the same?

            This may be a rant of an angsty teenager but I believe that the greater cause of humanity is meant more than just playing a role. One day. One day, I will stand up and protest
            against the way of tradition.

            The outsiders arrived a month ago claiming they came from planet Earth and wished to exist with us. We have plentiful resources, but not enough to serve two million new humans and the billions
            they said would come.
            The demanded that from human to human we must coorporate. We understand and we sympathize, but we simply do not have enough resources and it is the people of Aurora that will come
            before the people of Earth. We told them  to go home back to their planet. A man on our planet was shot. I do not understand why. The Earth people left and said that they would be back.

            I have never felt fear like this before. The idea that another human would cause harm to us is new to me. I don't trust that the Earth people are going to be back with any good intention.
            We have to do something about this for the people of Aurora. I've decided I'm going  to work hard from  here on and do everything in my capacity to build something that will defend our planet.
            Someone has to do it, so it may as well be  me.
