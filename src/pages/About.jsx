            <h2>Should humanity embark on space travel and become and interplanetary species?</h2>
            <p>
                The prospect of space travel and becoming an interplanetary species has sparked curiosity in the
                recent decades of technological development. Among the multiple avenues of space travel is the concept
                of a generation ship - a spacecraft intended for long distance travel comprising of several decades resulting
                in multiple generations living aboard this ship. This innovation would provide humanity a vehicle to terraform
                and colonise far-away planets. As with every great idea comes a plethora of ethical questions.
                What about the aspects of birth and quality of life during this journey? What reason do we have to heavily
                invest in this in the first place? Are the high risks worth the pursuit? These questions pose an interesting
                discussion surrounding the question; should humans embark on space travel and becoming an interplanetary species?
            </p>
            <p>
                To explore the ethical landscape of this question, I pose three hypothetical universes.

            <h1>Universe A-10</h1>
            <p>
                In the year 2050, the population surpasses 10 billion, placing major strain on Earth’s resources.
                There are talks of searching for a new planet to exploit, but that would mean a trade-off in investing
                for those that are suffering on Earth.
            </p>
