            <h2>Should humanity embark on space travel and become an interplanetary species?</h2>
            <p>
                The prospect of space travel and becoming an interplanetary species has sparked curiosity in the
                recent decades of technological development. Among the multiple avenues of space travel is the concept
                of a generation ship - a spacecraft intended for long distance travel comprising of several decades resulting
                in multiple generations living aboard this ship. This innovation would provide humanity a vehicle to terraform
                and colonise far-away planets. As with every great idea comes a plethora of ethical questions.
                What about the aspects of birth and quality of life during this journey? Are the high risks worth the pursuit?
                Shouldn't we first focus on Earth before venturing into space? These questions pose an interesting
                discussion surrounding the question; should humans embark on space travel and becoming an interplanetary species?
            </p>
            <p>
                Through posing three hypothetical  universes, I  aim to explore the ethical dimensions of space travel. The first universe presents
                a situation where in the year 2050 a population boom places major strain on Earth's resources sparking debate on whether or not we should
                venture into space to  save humanity. This will be presented through a timeline where at each time point I will not only briefly describe
                the events that took place  but also what ethical considerations we must make in such situations and  whether  or not  humanity should aim to become
                interplanetary in times of crisis. The second universe will more deeply explore the risks of space travel through a point and click of planet Earth, a
                generation ship and an Earth Analogue planet where I will discuss about problems and how  to mitigate them.
                Finally the third universe presents several diary entries at different time points
                starting from John Lee who is aboard a generation ship, ending with Titanium  5 of Aurora  who was born on the a far-away planet called Aurora.
                The characters serve as vehicles to drive home the central question by bringing in the existential idea of humanity's purpose and place in the greater universe.
